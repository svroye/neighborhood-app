# Neighborhood Project
This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.

For this project, I used both the Google Maps API and the NYT API.

It contains a map from Ghent, Belgium, with some important and nice places to visit. These places are shown by markers. A list is shown on the left of the page with the names and addresses of these places. Clicking a place in the list or on a marker on the map opens an info window with extra info (some (if any) NYT articles of the place and a Google StreetView panorama picture). An input field is show to filter the list and map in real-time.

### How to use
- Clone the repository to your local device
- Open the index.html page in your browser
- Start searching for your favorite places !
